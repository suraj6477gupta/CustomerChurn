# Churn_analysis


Summary


Project Overview: 

The goal of this project was to develop a churn prediction model for No-Churn Telecom, an established telecom operator in Europe.
With increasing competition in the market, retaining customers has become a challenge, and the churn rate is above 10%.

Project Approach: 
We approached the project by analyzing a dataset containing various customer attributes such as account length, international plan, voicemail plan, call duration, charges, and customer service calls.
We performed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Selection: 
For churn prediction, we chose to use the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful gradient boosting technique known for its effectiveness in handling classification problems.
XGBoost provides excellent predictive performance and handles imbalanced data well, making it suitable for our project.

Feature and Model Selection: 
Through a combination of feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis and feature importance from XGBoost, we identified the most significant predictors of churn.
These features included account length, international plan, voicemail plan, call duration, charges, and customer service calls.
We refined the model by finding optimized threshold probabitly by using self-created library called BrainBay.

Final Result: 
The trained XGBoost model achieved a high predictive accuracy in identifying churn customers.
We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a particular focus on the F1-score due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
The model demonstrated promising results with f1 score of 97%, indicating its ability to accurately identify potential churn customers.

Project Impact: 
The churn prediction model developed in this project can be instrumental in helping No-Churn Telecom proactively retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
By identifying customers at risk of churn, targeted retention campaigns can be designed, and personalized offers can be provided to mitigate customer churn.
This can lead to increased customer loyalty, reduced churn rate, and improved business profitability.
Throughout the project, we followed best practices in data science, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. The project highlighted the importance of understanding business objectives, feature engineering, and model selection for solving real-world problems. It also showcased the effectiveness of XGBoost in churn prediction tasks.

Challenges
Imbalanced Dataset: 
One of the significant challenges in this project was dealing with an imbalanced dataset, where the number of churn customers was relatively small compared to non-churn customers.
This imbalance can lead to biased model predictions and difficulties in accurately identifying churn cases.
To overcome this challenge, we employed over sampling technique and focused on appropriate evaluation metrics like F1-score.

Feature Selection: 
Another challenge was selecting the most relevant features from a large set of available variables.
It required a thorough understanding of the business domain and data exploration techniques to identify the features that have a significant impact on churn prediction.
Applying feature selection methods like correlation analysis and feature importance from the XGBoost model helped us address this challenge.

Model Optimisation: 
Optimizing the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model was a non-trivial task. With a wide range of hyperparameters available, finding the optimal combination can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.
However, we noticed that hyperparameter tuning slighly decreases the model performance.
Instead we focused on finding the optimum value for probablity which determines whether customer will churn or not. Luckily, the optimum value obtained was 0.5 which was the default value.

Interpretability of the Model: 
While XGBoost provides excellent predictive performance, it is considered a black-box model, making it challenging to interpret the reasoning behind its predictions.
Interpreting the model's decisions and explaining them to stakeholders can be crucial, especially in a business setting.
We employed techniques like Recursice feature elimination and feature importance analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process and enhance its interpretability.

Generalization and Deployment: 
After developing and fine-tuning the churn prediction model, deploying it in a production environment can pose challenges. Ensuring that the model performs well on unseen data and generalizes to new customers is essential.
We addressed this challenge by carefully evaluating the model's performance on validation and test datasets and conducting rigorous testing before deployment.

Business Context and Constraints: 
Understanding the specific business context and constraints of No-Churn Telecom was critical for developing an effective churn prediction solution. - Incorporating domain knowledge, considering business objectives, and aligning the model's outputs with practical actions and decision-making processes were challenges that required close collaboration with project mentors and subject matter experts.
By recognizing and addressing these challenges throughout the project, we were able to develop a robust churn prediction model that provided valuable insights and actionable recommendations for No-Churn Telecom to tackle customer churn effectively.
